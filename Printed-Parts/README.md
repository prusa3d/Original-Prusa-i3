# Converted Prusa i3 MK3 files
Hi everyone! 

This is the fork of the Prusa i3 MK3, except I have converted the OpenSCAD files to STEP and made an assembly using SolidWorks Student Edition 2017-2018.

Unfortunately, the Assembly STEP file is too large for Github, so I also have the files on GrabCAD.
